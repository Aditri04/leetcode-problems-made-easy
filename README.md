# leetcode-problems-made-easy

Includes my solutions and explaination to the Leetcode problem from the 150 interview prep series.

Things I remind myself to become better at solving Leetcode problems:

1. Dont jump straight into the problem. Try to break it down.
2. Before writing your code, get confortable with the input parameters. Understand how they work.
3. Dont be afraid to use print statements and rerun your code multiple times. Nobody can come up with a solution within their first try.
4. Take breaks in between but be consistent in solving leetcode problems. Leetcode problem can feel like climbing a huge mountain but we need to take it one step at a time.
5. Ask for help. Asking for help doesnt mean that you are dumb.
6. Always be on a lookout for people who can solve a problem differently than you. Dont forget about the problem once you have solved it. Besides there is always someone who comes up with a solution more efficient than yours.
